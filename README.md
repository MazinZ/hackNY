# hackNY

The "hackNYscript.cs" file is the script that can be used in unity to instantiate 3D .obj models from a given base url (ours was https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackny.springhurst/). We used C# to make calls from a web interface to a Wolfram Mathematica kernel through a protocol called NETLink to generate the 3d models given a math equation, chemical name or protein name. 

You will need a vuforia developer account and OBJReader (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/152) to test this code.
